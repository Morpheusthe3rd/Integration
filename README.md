# Integration
Integration code.

This repository is ment as an escape from the extremely laggy VNC coding that I have hitherto had to deal with on my Raspberry PI 3B+. It will contain all of the relevant drivers for motor operation and sensor navigation. 

Current status:

Motion control semi-functional. Difficulties with PWM control for motor speed.
Navigation semi-functional. Able to recieve data based on position, and able to recieve enemy position. Unable to parse data from unknown        enemy adresses. 
Operating strategy: non-functional.
Remote control: non-functional.
Ancellary sensors: non-functional.

Next Steps: 

0.) Implement comprehensive logging
1.) Perfect Motor control.
2.) Implement Remote Control.
3.) Perfect autonomous Navigation.
